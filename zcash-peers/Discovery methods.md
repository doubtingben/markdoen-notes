title: Discovery methods
---

# dns seeder

## Pros
Use the same seeder process that the Zcash foundation created.

This would be a good way to become familiar with the software for other deployments.

Reuses existing work on node discovery and filtering.

## Cons
That filtering may be a problem depending on its implementation.

The network magic numbers might have to stop added to the program as valid.

# Kubernetes operator

## Pros

Integration with CI and future developments is very high

Fun

## Cons

Unknown development integration. There are lots of frameworks available!
